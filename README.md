This is a mod that can help you with some classic vanilla afk farm and something else.

This mod is client side only, so you can use it in every vanilla server!

 

Keybinding:

O - Press it to hold use action (right click) and leave minecraft alone (useful for afk fishing farm). After pressing this, you can switch to any other application using ALT+TAB or WIN+TAB combination without pause the game.

P - Under developing...

 

Thanks to the Acquario's team for the inspiration.
