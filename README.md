# Easy Vanilla

**This is a mod that can help you with some classic vanilla afk farm and something else.**
### This mod is client side only, so you can use it in every vanilla server!

## Key bindings:
- **O** - Press it to hold use action (right click) and leave minecraft alone (useful for afk fishing farm).
- **P** - Press to start auto-fishing. No need for any farm, the player will check if a fish was caught, pick the hook and reuse.

After pressing any command, you can switch to any other application using ALT+TAB or WIN+TAB combination without pause the game. 

Thanks to the Acquario's team for the inspiration.
